Ok, I just want to understand how it works.

Abstract
In the early 20th century, when oil was discovered in Khuzestan, the native Arab population was ‎the dominant socio-political group in most parts of the region. A century later, they are among the ‎most marginalized in Iran. What role did the oil industry play in this transformation? Drawing on ‎archival research, this paper argues that the racialization of native populations has been central to ‎the logic of oil capitalism. In Khuzestan, this began with the exclusion of Arabs from employment ‎in the colonial oil company, severing their access to new forms of social reproduction and ‎rendering them external to an industry that relied on their land. This exclusion persisted even after ‎oil nationalization, revealing how oil capitalism operates through domestic colonialism. The paper ‎contends that addressing the social and ecological consequences of the fossil fuel industry requires ‎closer attention to how it disrupts the social reproduction of affected communities.‎

Introduction ‎
Since the early 20th century, petroleum has played a crucial role in shaping the interconnected and ‎multifaceted built environments that define our global landscape. The use of petroleum products ‎has become a defining feature of urban life, with oil infrastructure serving as the connective tissue ‎linking spatially distant and seemingly disparate cities and rural areas. Alongside the transformation ‎of space, oil has also reshaped social reproduction: the political, cultural, and environmental ‎processes that sustain daily life and support communities across generations. (Mitchell et al., 2003; ‎Meehan & Strauss, 2015). Today, fossil fuels are so deeply ingrained in our social reproduction ‎that imagining a world without petroleum is nearly impossible (LeMenager, 2014).‎
Fossil fuels have fundamentally altered our perception of time and space and reshaped concepts ‎such as nation-state building, nationalism, democracy, freedom, population, and human subjectivity ‎‎(Szeman & Wellum, 2021). These concepts are intricately intertwined with oil consumption, ‎significantly shaping how we reproduce ourselves as a society, community, and individuals. At the ‎same time, fossil fuels have had profound and far-reaching consequences for the global climate. ‎Therefore, it is crucial to integrate an understanding of social reproduction in the geographies of oil ‎production into both literature and action aimed at combating climate change. ‎
